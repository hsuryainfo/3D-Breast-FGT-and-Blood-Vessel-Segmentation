# total breast volume (prolly an overestimate)
# non fat tissue volume in cc post contrast
# look at pre contrast for comparison
# show the images associated with it
# only care about post contrast and calculate percent signal intensity
# display the images/ histogram
# overlay the signal intensity over the original image (original MRI)
# side by side if overlay not possible
# maybe use pre over post? look at paper
